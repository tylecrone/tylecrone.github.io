  <p><img src="chucke.jpg"> "I know this sounds <i>cheesy</i>, but I really owe every thing to Dr. Cool. I wouldn't have had the courage to start up my company if it weren't for him. He really works wonders for your confidence and social life, best decision of my life!"

I don't exactly know how that's physically possible in two weeks through verbal communication alone, but he did it. The man isn't just a doctor, he's a magician!"
