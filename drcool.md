		Hey, you! Yeah, <B>you</B>!
		You look like the kind of kid who likes to stay in on a friday night and pound down 3 bags of cool ranch doritos instead of going out like a normal human being!
		You need to spice up a party?
		Don't kid yourself, buddy, I'm pretty sure that whole cool ranch doritos analogy was a generous estimation.
		Well, you've come to the right place!
		Looks like you need to hire:
		</P>
		<H2><B>DR. COOL, P.H.D.</B></H2>
		<P>
		You're probably wondering to yourself:
		But Mr. Cool, how exactly <I>did</I> you get so cool?
		Well, first off, hot-shot, it's <B>Dr.</B> Cool.
		That P.H.D. stands for:
		<UL>
			<P><L1><B>Powerful,</B></L1></P>
			<P><L2><B>Helpful</B> and</L2></P>
			<P><L3><B>Doubtfully-Medically-Licensed.</B></L3></P>
		</UL>
		So, if you disrespect the P.H.D. again, I'm gonna personally go to your school and/or place of work
		and tell everybody that you like to go to the zoo on the weekends and push kids into the tiger cages for fun.</P>
			<P><B>You sick bastard.</B></P>
		Secondly, I don't like to be questioned,
		so how about you quit with the jabber-jaw
		and pick that thing up from the floor.
		You're embarrassing yourself in the presence of greatness.
		</P>
		<P>
		So now that we have that mess of a first impression sorted out,
		hopefully we can get past how uncomfortable you make me,
		and most likely everyone around you,
		and we can get to work.
		The following are some resources that you may find useful
		in your quest towards coolness:
